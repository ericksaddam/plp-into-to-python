Objective: To learn how to take user input in Python

Write a program that asks the user for their name, age, and location and then prints out a personalized message.

Create a new Python file and name it "user_input.py"
Use the input() function to ask the user for their name and store it in a variable called "name".
Use the input() function to ask the user for their age and store it in a variable called "age".
Use the input() function to ask the user for their location and store it in a variable called "location".
